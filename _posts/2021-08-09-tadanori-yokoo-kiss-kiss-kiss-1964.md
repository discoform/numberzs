      Tadanori Yokoo is a Japanese graphic designer, illustrator, printmaker and
      painter. In the sixties Yokoo created a series of animated short films.


      Here’s one example of Tadanori Yokoo's filmwork, “Kiss Kiss Kiss” (1964). The film is bright and illustrative, typical of the Yokoo style.
