      ***Gisele Kerozene*** is a strange stop-motion film from director Jan
      Kounen. The depiction of witchy trolls racing throughout an urban
      landscape on diesel-fueled flying brooms is like an intersection of the
      Wizard of Oz and Akira's infamous \`Bike Scene\`. 


      Three witches give chase to a thief who has stolen a small statue. One by one, the thief eludes or dispatches his pursuers, as they zoom through the cityscape.
