      French filmmaker **Chris Marker** will forever be one of our most beloved
      *visionnaires*. His dystopian points of view are beautifully articulated
      in short films like *La Jetée (1962)* and
      *[Junkopia](https://numberzs.com/chris-marker-junkopia-criterion-collection/)*,
      and in feature length experimental films like *Level Five* (to name just a
      couple of our favorites).


      Lesser known video works by Chris Marker are seen in the collection *Bestiaire,* aka *Petit Bestiaire* from 1990. In these short videos Marker focuses his camera on one or another species from the animal kingdom.


      ***An Owl is an Owl is an Owl*** is a short that edits together a sequence of different species of owls, often turning their head to stare back at the lens, and set to electronically treated phrases and synthetic sounds.
