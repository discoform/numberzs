      French filmmaker **Chris Marker** will forever be one of our most
      beloved *visionnaires*. His dystopian points of view are beautifully
      articulated in short films like *La Jetée
      (1962)* and *[Junkopia](https://numberzs.com/chris-marker-junkopia-criterion-collection/)*,
      and in feature length experimental films like *Level Five* (to name just a
      couple of our favorites).


      Lesser known video works by Chris Marker can be seen in the Chris Marker collection *Bestiaire* aka *Petit Bestiaire* from 1990. In these short videos Marker focuses his camera on one or another species from the animal kingdom.


      **Chat écoutant la musique** is one of three films from the collection, and we rank it as our favorite.


      In this short video we're treated to a soundtrack of melancholic piano music, glimpses of Chris Marker's creative living space, some of his musical instruments (including a classic Yamaha DX-7) and, of course, footage of his beloved cats napping and listening to music.
