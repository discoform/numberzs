      French filmmaker **Chris Marker** will forever be one of our most beloved
      *visionnaires*. His dystopian points of view are beautifully articulated
      in short films like *La Jetée (1962)* and
      *[Junkopia](https://numberzs.com/chris-marker-junkopia-criterion-collection/)*,
      and in feature length experimental films like *Level Five* (to name just a
      couple of our favorites).


      Lesser known video works by Chris Marker are seen in the collection *Bestiaire,* aka *Petit Bestiaire* from 1990. In these short videos Marker focuses his camera on one or another species from the animal kingdom.


      **Zoo Piece** is one of three films from *Bestiaire*, and is by far the most difficult to watch. Seeing a sequence of wild and domestic animals kept in cages in a Zoo setting evokes the sadness and helplessness I feel when visiting a Zoo in real life.


      I find myself returning to this particular episode of *Petit Bestiaire* very infrequently.
