      Jordan Belson is a somewhat lesser known and somewhat less influential
      animator from the 1960's and 1970's (relative to someone like John
      Whitney, at least).


      I think Belson's partial obscurity is mainly due to the extreme control of organizations like the Center for Visual Music, who have a vested interest in selling DVD's of some animator's works. 


      Nevertheless, this teaser for Jordan Belson's Mandala provides some indication as to just how sophisticated his work can be.
