      John Whitney, Sr. is well known as an American animator, composer and
      inventor. He is widely considered to be one of the fathers of computer
      animation, and there is a wealth of material to review.


      John Whitney’s *Catalog,* from 1961, is reel of work created with his analog computer combined with film camera he built from a World War II anti-aircraft gun sight.


      Whitney and the techniques he developed with this machine were what inspired Douglas Trumbull to use the slit scan technique in Stanley Kubrik's  *2001: A Space Odyssey* during the Stargate sequence of the film.
